# ✅ Supabase Migration Complete!

Your ImageGen app has been successfully migrated to use **Supabase Storage** for all image storage and management.

## 🚀 What's Working Now

✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase  
✅ **Image Storage**: Supabase Storage with CDN  
✅ **Image Upload**: Direct to Supabase Storage  
✅ **Image Generation**: Saves to Supabase Storage  
✅ **Gallery**: Database-driven (no more JSON files)  
✅ **Upload History**: Database-driven (no more JSON files)  

## 🔧 Configuration Applied

Your `.env` file has been updated with:
- Supabase database connection strings
- Supabase API keys and URLs
- Proper pooling configuration

## 📦 Storage Bucket

The `images` bucket has been created in your Supabase project with:
- **Public access** for serving images
- **10MB file size limit**
- **Allowed formats**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF

## ⚠️ Important: Set Up Storage Policies

You need to manually set up storage policies in the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kkrhbzpmijfgylyzdxba
2. Navigate to **Storage > Policies**
3. Create these policies for the `images` bucket:

### 🔓 SELECT Policy (Public Access)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

### 📤 INSERT Policy (Authenticated Uploads)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'images');
```

### 🗑️ DELETE Policy (Authenticated Deletes)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'images');
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
npm run test:supabase
```

Or test manually by:
1. Opening http://localhost:3000
2. Uploading an image
3. Generating an image
4. Checking the Supabase Storage dashboard

## 🎯 Benefits You Now Have

- **Scalable**: Handles any amount of images
- **Fast**: Global CDN for image delivery
- **Reliable**: Automatic backups and 99.9% uptime
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for storage used
- **Secure**: Row-level security policies
- **Production-ready**: No more local file management

## 📝 Next Development Steps

1. **Set up the storage policies** (see above)
2. **Test image upload/generation** in your app
3. **Remove any old local image files** if desired
4. **Deploy to production** - your app is now cloud-native!

Your app is now fully modernized with cloud storage! 🚀
